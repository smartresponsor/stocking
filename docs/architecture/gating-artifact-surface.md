# Gating artifacts

The repository-local `.gating/` directory is reserved for generated Gating artifacts only.

Allowed content includes generated reports, evidence, checksums, and other verification artifacts.
Executable rules and policy are provided by the `gating/gate` Composer package.
Repository-specific Gating configuration belongs under Symfony `config/`, not here.
